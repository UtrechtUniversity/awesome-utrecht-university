Beside topics like Open access , Public engagement , and Recognition and rewards , there is a strong focus on FAIR Data and Software .

Add project to this list Do you know about a project that should be in the Awesome Utrecht University list? This could be your own project or a project of one of your colleagues. We would love to hear about that project! The contribution guidelines help you to propose a new project to the list. Background What is an Awesome list? \"Awesome lists\" are curated lists of awesome stuff. The lists are very popular in the field of open source development (see https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Read \"The awesome manifesto\" for more information about awesome lists. Initial project collection The initial collection of projects was made based on the collected repositories from the SWORDS-UU project (more information follows soon). Repositories were considered when they have a license and 25 stars or fulfill 4/5 FAIR criteria. Implementing Awesome lists for your university We encourage other universities to also implement awesome lists for their research. You can fork this repository as a starting point. Having such a list is a useful resource to showcase good projects that have been conducted or are still ongoing and helps promoting the open science approach. If you need help getting started please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We will gladly assist you. Contact This awesome list was created by efforts of the FAIR Data and Software team of Utrecht University. If you have any question or remark about this list, do not hesitate to contact Keven Quach and Jonathan de Bruin via mail or open an issue on GitHub. Are you a Utrecht University researcher looking for support on making your research code and data open and FAIR? Or do you want to brainstorm about these topics?
