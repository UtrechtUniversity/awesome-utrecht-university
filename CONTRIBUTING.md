## Guideline

When can a project be added to the list?

It should include the following points:

* It should be maintained by at least one UU researcher or employee
* It should include a license
* It should include a readme with a project description
* It should be inspirational or useful to other researchers

Please send a pull request or [create an issue](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/awesome-utrecht-university/issues/new/choose) for adding your projects. Pull requests are preferred.

### Adding new categories

If there is no fitting category for your project please add a pull request with further reasoning as to why a new category is necessary.
